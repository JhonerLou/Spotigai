üéµ Spotigai: Mood-Based Music Player

Spotigai is a Flask web application that generates personalized music playlists based on your mood and streams them using YouTube. It combines songs from a large dataset with tracks from your own Spotify library to create a unique listening experience.

‚ú® Overview

Users log in with their Spotify account, select a mood (Happy, Sad, Calm, Energetic), 
choose one of their Spotify playlists, optionally set a year range, and specify 
the desired number of songs. The application then:

1. Loads a pre-processed dataset (`standardized_song_list.csv`) containing songs 
   with mood labels.
2. Fetches tracks from the user's selected Spotify playlist.
3. Filters both datasets based on the selected mood (for the CSV) and year range 
   (for both).
4. Creates a combined playlist, prioritizing songs (~80%) matching the mood from 
   the dataset and supplementing (~20%) with songs from the user's playlist 
   within the year range.
5. Searches YouTube for corresponding music videos for the selected songs.
6. Presents an embedded YouTube player that streams the generated playlist with 
   looping and basic playback controls.

Data Preparation

1. Place your raw data (e.g., `full_song_list.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the standardization script:
   >>> python standardize_data.py
3. This creates `standardized_song_list.csv`. Check script output for errors.


üö¶ Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment.
2. Ensure `standardized_song_list.csv` exists.
3. Run the Flask app:
   >>> python app.py
4. Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888/
5. Log in with Spotify.
6. Make selections on the /select page.
7. Click "Generate Playlist".
8. Player page loads and starts playing.
